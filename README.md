## General Info
In this project, i used supervised models to classify disaster messagens into
36 different catergories. The goal was to deploy the machine learning model to
help make these classifications. The Disaster Response project has educational purpose.

## Technologies

I used python 3.6.3 to code this project. You can find the package versions utilized [here](https://github.com/vitorscheifler/figure-eight-pipeline/blob/master/requirements.txt).

## Usage
To run this project, you will need to clone the repository in your local machine:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/vitorscheifler/figure-eight-pipeline.git
```
After cloning the repository, cd to the app folder and run run.py file.

```bash
python run.py
```
You can copy the port and open the corresponding ip with port on the browser.
(example http://127.0.0.1:5000/)
